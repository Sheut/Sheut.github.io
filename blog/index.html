          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Hello, I am the author/creator of this post and website, it is here as a creative outlet and a place to do things.
            <br> The scope and purpose of it is fairly casualand subject to change but for now it consists of the following 3 parts.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>A blog</h3> <br>
          <p>
            Yes this very blog you are reading now, fairly self explanitory,
            simply put an informal place to get some thoughts out and communicate with yall :)
          </p> <br>
          <h3>There is a game-like thing on here somewhere</h3> <br>
          <p>
            Basically a under development game space that if all goes well will become the king of scope-creep. <br>
            It serves a primary porpose of education and feature testing for myself, so don't be surprised if you find it in a nonsensical state. <br>
            Given enougth time i'll fully form it into something quite special, tho it might take a few years to get there. 
          </p>
        <h3>The Art section containes art.</h3>
        <p>
          Once again no big surprise here... I try to label my stuff logically. <br>
          This part of the website is for showcasing art of any kind, it started out with some CSS generated patternwork. <br>
          And as the time goes on I'll add more of what I have to show here.
        </p>
        <h3>Origin</h3>
        <p>
          So I got the domain endthecult.com after volenteering at a organization with some cult-like behaviors. <br>
          Nothing too wild happened in my time there, just alot of wierd peer pressure and health and safty violations mostly, along with some suspicious behavior around money ofcourse. <br>
          At the time I felt like starting a blog or something to vent about it so I baught the domain, hence the name 'end the cult'. <br>
          I moved on and that initial blog idea i never got around too, however the domain stayed. <br>
          And since then I have noticed alot of simular cult like behaviors in sociaty, so the name grew on me and I planned on using it for thename of a game studio. <br>
          However progress on that is slow, so I started using the domain for testing things and whatever I wanted to put online. <br>
          So that brings us to the present where I'm finally publishing the first 'real' blog post, and using the site in a
