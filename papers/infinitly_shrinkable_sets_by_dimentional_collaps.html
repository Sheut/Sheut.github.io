<h1>Hypothesis/Conjecture = Any set can be mapped to any other.</h1>
<br><br>
<h3>I will start by prooving the set of rational numbers |R| can be mapped to the set of natural numbers |N|.</h3>
<br>
<p>
 So...<br><br>
 |R|=|N|=â„µ0 
 <br><br>
 So to start, lets assume all rational numbers can be expressed as fractions or decimal numbers,<br>
 now lets assume a set of all numbers and fractions will also contain all of these fractions and decimal numbers<br>
 So once we show this set of all numbers and fractions can be mapped to the natural number set,<br>
 and that <a text="pno new number outside of it can be created" href="../papers/cardinality_of_sets_disproof">no new number outside of it can be created</a><br>
 it will be apperent that these sets are the same.<br>
 only differing in the meaning we project onto them.<br>
