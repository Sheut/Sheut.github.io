<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>
 If you have seen the proof for some infinities being larger than others it goes something like this... <br>
 You start with a set of numbers, something like... <br>
 <br>
 314<br>
 111<br>
 789<br>
 <br>
 And then to show that there is an set of numbers that is provably NOT inside the set of numbers you already have here, <br>
 you take the first digit of the first number(314) in this case 3, and change it to any number other than what it originally is... i'll use 4,<br>
 then you take the second digit of the second number and change it too, then the third of the third and so on...<br>
 So in this example I'll change 3 to 4, 1 to 2, 9 to 0, and end up with the number 420.<br>
 <br>
 Now the conventional proof goes that the number 420 is definitively not in the first set of numbers I started with...<br>
 because it cannot be the first number since the first digit is different...<br>
 it cannot be the second because the second is different,<br>
 it cannot be the third because the number in the third place is different, <br>
 and you can continue doing this for as long a number as you want,<br>
 infact you can do this for an infinitly long number if you like.<br>
 So the preposed conclousion is that even if you have an infinitly big set of infinitly long numbers, you can using this method always create a new number that is not in that set.<br>
 Using the assumption that infinity is like an infinit set of numbers, <br>
 and this conclusion that you can create a new number that is not in this infinit set of numbers,<br>
 it is said that this new number has to be outside of this first infinity,<br>
 so therefor it is commonly conclouded that there is some numbers not containable inside a regular infinity,<br>
 and that there are possibly an infinit ammount of these numbers,<br>
 and finally we get to the conclousion that there are multiple different infinit numbers that cannot be contained within eachother,<br>
 and therefor that there are multiple different infinities.<br>
 <br>
 So this is a sloppy version of the usual proof for the existance of multiple different types of infinity.<br>
 Here's some links to other explinations of it in perhaps better understanable formats,(TODO add links to bottom of page and a jump link to links here)<br>
 <br>
 now this is all fine and dandy, but don't you feel like we missed something?<br>
 and i'm not talking about that feeling i cant quite put my fingure on that we perhaps had a jump in logic in the second half of the proof,<br>
 in the first part about creating a new number that is not within the original set of number we have.<br>
 if you like you can pause here and try to spot it, we made an unstated assumption. <br>
 it's about the number we created, it is not in the set of numbers we checked. <br>
 but what set of number did we start with, and what set of numbers did we check?<br>
 and importantly are they the same set of numbers?<br>
 <br>
 now lets go over the first part creating a 'new' number again<br>
 but just a bit more carefully<br>
 
 ... if finish this in a bit hehe
