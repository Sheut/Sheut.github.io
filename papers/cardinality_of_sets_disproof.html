<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>
 If you have seen the proof for some infinities being larger than others it goes something like this... <br>
 You start with a set of numbers, something like... <br>
 <br>
 314<br>
 111<br>
 789<br>
 <br>
 And then to show that there is an set of numbers that is provably NOT inside the set of numbers you already have here, <br>
 you take the first digit of the first number(314) in this case 3, and change it to any number other than what it originally is... i'll use 4,<br>
 then you take the second digit of the second number and change it too, then the third of the third and so on...<br>
 So in this example I'll change 3 to 4, 1 to 2, 9 to 0, and end up with the number 420.<br>
 <br>
 Now the conventional proof goes that the number 420 is definitively not in the first set of numbers I started with...<br>
 because it cannot be the first number since the first digit is different...<br>
 it cannot be the second because the second is different,<br>
 it cannot be the third because the number in the third place is different, <br>
 and you can continue doing this for as long a number as you want,<br>
 infact you can do this for an infinitly long number if you like.<br>
 So the preposed conclousion is that even if you have an infinitly big set of infinitly long numbers, you can using this method always create a new number that is not in that set.<br>
 Using the assumption that infinity is like an infinit set of numbers, <br>
 and this conclusion that you can create a new number that is not in this infinit set of numbers,<br>
 it is said that this new number has to be outside of this first infinity,<br>
 so therefor it is commonly conclouded that there is some numbers not containable inside a regular infinity,<br>
 and that there are possibly an infinit ammount of these numbers,<br>
 and finally we get to the conclousion that there are multiple different infinit numbers that cannot be contained within eachother,<br>
 and therefor that there are multiple different infinities.<br>
 <br>
 So this is a sloppy version of the usual proof for the existance of multiple different types of infinity.<br>
 Here's some links to other explinations of it in perhaps better understanable formats,(TODO add links to bottom of page and a jump link to links here)<br>

 <br>
 <br>
 now this is all fine and dandy, but don't you feel like we missed something?<br>
 and i'm not talking about that feeling i cant quite put my fingure on that we perhaps had a jump in logic in the second half of the proof,<br>
 in the first part about creating a new number that is not within the original set of number we have.<br>
 if you like you can pause here and try to spot it, we made an unstated assumption. <br>
 it's about the number we created, it is not in the set of numbers we checked. <br>
 but what set of number did we start with, and what set of numbers did we check?<br>
 and importantly are they the same set of numbers?<br>
 <br>
 now lets go over the first part creating a 'new' number again<br>
 but just a bit more carefully<br>
 <br>
 this time lets fill our starting set like an infinit one would be<br>
 so our first digits will be<br>
 <br>
 0<br>
 1<br>
 2<br>
 3<br>
 4<br>
 5<br>
 6<br>
 7<br>
 8<br>
 9<br>
 <br>
 same with our second, third and so on...<br>
 now do you see the problem<br>
 if we take the first digit and change it, the new number is still in the set of numbers we have.<br>
 same with the second and so on<br>
 <br>
 it is eazier to show in bianary spacewise, if you understand bianay that is<br>
 i'll link something for that here<br>
 <br>
 so now se see that the new number wemake is always already in the set of numbers we have<br>
 it just didnt show up becouse in the initial proof we only check the first small section of the set for it,<br>
 and not he whole set so we missed it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 so where do we go from here?<br>
 well in my humble opinion first of all double check my work, and check the original proof for yourself<br>
 and look for more proofs if they exist and check for their validity or lack thereof.<br>
 <br>
 My hypothises (link)? is that there is only one infinty, or if you prefere a different wording that all infinit sets can be mapped onto eachother.<br> 
 I have started a draft of a proof (link?) that shows that shows this, <br>
 by proving that any definable set can be mapped onto regular rational number infinity.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 basically in a full and ordered set of numbers you cannot create a new number that is not in the set, <br>
 for example if you try to create a new number with the aformentioned method and addition<br>
 then, if your original number is X your new number is N and the amount you add is Y,<br>
 then the new number N will always already be in your full ordered set at position X+Y<br>
 this fact is also true for unordered sets, the number is just harder to find.<br>
 and for set that is not what i'm reffering to as 'full' is just a subset of the natural numbers<br>
 and for this nubset it will be true for creating numbers within the subset aswell.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 This is easy to show with bruit force<br>
 I will do so now using bianary for the sake of brevity<br>
 however this works the same in base 10 or any other base system<br>
 so here is a full set that can continue into infinity<br>
 <br>
 0<br>
 1<br>
 <br>
 00<br>
 01<br>
 10<br>
 11<br>
 <br>
 000
 001
 010
 011
 100
 101
 110
 111
 <br>
 and so on...
 now we see that if we use the usual method of creating a new number<br>
 changing between 1 and 0 doesn't help us, the new number is always already in the set<br>
 and it will always be in the set.<br>
 <br>
 so yeah that's my proof<br>
 I'll be making it pretty in the coming days<br>
 and you will see it soon I guess<br>
 tho probably in past tense archives if you actually find this draft lol :)<br>
 like fr what are you doing here in thee old repo history texts?<br>
 nice tohave you anyways have a good day friend<br>
 ttyl<br>
 -s<br>
 <br><br>
 
 that should do it for 
 
 
 
 
 ... i'll finish this in a bit hehe
